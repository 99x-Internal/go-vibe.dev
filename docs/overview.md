# go-vibe Overview

## Introduction

go-vibe is an iterative software development process that leverages AI-assisted documentation and code generation to enhance productivity and maintain code quality.

## go-vibe Iterative Process

The go-vibe process consists of several key components that work together to create a seamless development workflow:

### Documentation

- [**IDE Rules**](./ide-rules.md) - Describes how to define and use custom IDE rules, particularly in Cursor IDE, to enforce coding patterns and standards.

- [**Documentation Creation**](./doc-creation.md) - Explains how to generate and structure documentation using AI tools and markdown files, ensuring a single source of truth for both humans and AI.

- [**Code Generation**](./code-generation.md) - Provides guidelines for effectively using AI-powered code generation tools, including best practices for providing context, workflow recommendations, and development strategies.

- [**Documentation Evolution**](./doc-evolution.md) - Outlines the process for keeping documentation up to date with code changes, including update frequency, AI-assisted documentation, and team responsibilities.

Each of these components plays a vital role in the go-vibe process, enabling teams to maintain high-quality documentation alongside efficient, AI-assisted code development.
